# üîê Python Projects for Cybersecurity

Welcome! This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects that combine **programming fundamentals** with **cybersecurity concepts**.  

As a Cybersecurity student aspiring to work in **SOC analysis and security operations**, I‚Äôm using these projects to practice **log analysis, pattern detection, and secure coding techniques**.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Log Analyzer (Completed ‚úÖ)
- **Description:** A Python script that scans system logs for suspicious login attempts.  
- **Skills practiced:**  
  - File handling & string parsing in Python  
  - Using dictionaries to count events (e.g., failed logins)  
  - Detecting brute-force patterns (3+ failed attempts)  
- **SOC Analyst connection:** Log analysis is a core SOC skill ‚Äî this project simulates how analysts detect unusual authentication behavior.  
- **Folder:** [`log-analyzer/`](./log-analyzer)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Password Strength Checker (In Progress ‚è≥)
- **Description:** A tool that evaluates password strength using length, complexity, and dictionary checks.  
- **Skills to be learned:**  
  - Regex for pattern matching  
  - Security best practices (strong passwords)  
  - Writing functions and user input validation  
- **SOC Analyst connection:** Helps understand weak password risks often found in compromised accounts.  
- **Folder (coming soon):** `password-checker/`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Network Access Simulator (Planned üöÄ)
- **Description:** A simple simulation of network access rules (who can connect, who gets blocked).  
- **Skills to be learned:**  
  - Control flow & conditional logic in Python  
  - IP whitelisting/blacklisting  
  - Error handling  
- **SOC Analyst connection:** Simulates how access control lists (ACLs) are applied in real environments.  
- **Folder (coming soon):** `network-access-sim/`

## üåü Why This Repo?
- To **document my learning journey** in Python + Cybersecurity.  
- To **practice core SOC analyst skills** in small, practical ways.  
- To create **projects I can showcase** on GitHub and LinkedIn.  

---

## üìå Next Steps
- [x] Finish **Log Analyzer**  
- [ ] Build **Password Strength Checker**  
- [ ] Create **Network Access Simulator**  
- [ ] Expand into more advanced SOC projects (e.g., packet capture analysis, phishing detection)

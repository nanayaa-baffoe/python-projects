🔐 Python Projects for Cybersecurity

Welcome! This repository is a growing collection of Python projects that combine programming fundamentals with cybersecurity concepts.

I’m a Cybersecurity student aspiring to work in SOC analysis and security operations, and I’m using these projects to practice log analysis, pattern detection, and secure coding techniques.

📂 Projects
1️⃣ Log Analyzer (Completed ✅)

Description: A Python script that scans system logs and identifies IP addresses with suspicious activity.

Skills practiced:

File handling & string parsing in Python
